- 🌍 **Global coverage** – the dataset contains data from **~150+ countries**, allowing for broad cross-country comparisons.

  - **Log GDP per capita** (economic prosperity)

  - **Healthy life expectancy at birth** (health outcomes)
  - **Freedom to make life choices**
  - **Generosity**
  - **Perceptions of corruption**
